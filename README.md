# Tourney
Tourney is an open-source library for implementing games as well as artificial intelligence to play them. The fundamental classes are `Game` and `Agent`. A game (such as chess, go, etc.) can be added by deriving from the former and implementing each of its virtual functions. In contrast, agents are the objects which play the game; for example, the `HumanAgent` prompts the user for input, while `MinimaxAgent` searches the game tree for optimal moves.

[Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and its variations are a well-known family of algorithms for implementing chess computers. The central goal of Tourney is to make applying these algorithms to any two-player adversarial game as simple as possible.
## Work in Progress
We divide work broadly into that which pertains specifically to `chess.hpp` and that which does not.
### Chess-specific Work
* Refactor to use a [bitboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard#Chess_bitboards) architecture for move generation. This will be tedious but (hopefully) worth the effort.
  * Upon switching to bitboards, use `__builtin_popcountll` based evaluation functions.
* Implement the [fifty-move rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty-move_rule).
* Implement special moves: pawn promotions, en passant capture, and castling. Ensure `Parse` and `GetAlgebraicNotation` are updated appropriately as well.
* Add unit tests to guarantee correctness.
* Fix problem with knight move generation.
* Generalize parsing of algebraic notation to allow disambiguation via specification of the `from` square.
### General Work
* Consider switching `MinimaxAgent` to use the [negamax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax) to avoid branching.
* Make `history_` a vector of moves instead of a vector of strings. Then, if it's not *too* expensive, we could use this to eliminate `RecordMove` (but would require recording the move even if it's not yet selected).
* Consider avenues of improvement for `MinimaxAgent`: iterative deepening, transposition tables, random optimal move selection
* Implement `RandomAgent`, which selects uniformly from the set of possible moves.
* Design a tournament and ELO system to have many agents compete against each other.
* Implement other games: dots and boxes, 2048, blackjack, and poker.
* Consider whether declaring a `namespace tourney` would be appropriate
* Address any reported clang-tidy issues. Judicious use of `// NOLINT` is permissible.
* Continuously rewrite code to make it as self-documenting as possible. Resort to comments sparingly. Ensure that "the function" is the implicit subject of all comments and that proper punctuation is used.
